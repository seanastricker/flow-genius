# Phase 0: Barebones Setup

## Overview

This phase establishes the foundational project structure and basic framework for the BrainLift Generator desktop application. The goal is to create a minimal running Electron application with React frontend that can be launched and displays basic UI, but is not yet functional for end users.

## Phase Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Create a launchable Electron desktop application
- **Secondary Goal**: Establish development environment and build pipeline
- **Validation Goal**: Application opens, displays basic interface, and can be built for distribution

## Success Criteria

- [x] Electron application launches successfully on Windows
- [x] React frontend renders with basic navigation structure
- [x] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [x] Basic UI components display correctly
- [x] Development and build scripts function properly
- [x] Project follows established file structure and naming conventions

## Features and Tasks

**Description**: Initialize project with proper tooling, dependencies, and configuration files.

**Tasks**:
1. Initialize npm project with package.json and install core dependencies (Electron, React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)
2. Configure TypeScript with strict settings and path aliases (@/ imports)
3. Set up Vite build configuration for Electron renderer process
4. Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme tokens from theme-rules.md
5. Create basic project directory structure following project-rules.md

**Deliverables**:

3. Set up IPC message validation and security middleware
4. Configure Content Security Policy and security headers
5. Add basic application menu and window controls

**Deliverables**:
- `src/main/index.ts` - Main process entry point

2. Create basic application layout with header, main content, and status bar
3. Implement simple routing structure for main application screens
4. Add basic UI components (Button, Card, Layout) following theme-rules.md
5. Set up error boundary for graceful error handling

**Deliverables**:

- `src/renderer/components/layout/` - Basic layout components
- `src/renderer/components/ui/` - Basic UI components
- `src/renderer/pages/` - Basic page components

### Feature 4: Preload Script Security Bridge
**Description**: Implement secure communication bridge between main and renderer processes.

**Tasks**:
1. Create preload script with contextBridge API exposure
2. Define typed interfaces for IPC communication
3. Implement secure API methods for file system access
4. Add validation for all exposed APIs
5. Create TypeScript definitions for renderer process API access

**Deliverables**:
- `src/preload/index.ts` - Main preload script
- `src/preload/api-bridge.ts` - Secure API bridge
- `src/preload/types.ts` - API type definitions
- `src/shared/types/` - Shared type definitions
- Secure communication between processes

### Feature 5: Basic State Management
**Description**: Set up Zustand stores for application state management.

**Tasks**:
1. Configure Zustand with TypeScript and persistence middleware
2. Create basic document store for BrainLift document management
3. Implement UI state store for interface state (modals, panels)
4. Add settings store for user preferences
5. Set up store type definitions and barrel exports

**Deliverables**:
- `src/renderer/stores/document-store.ts` - Document state management
- `src/renderer/stores/ui-store.ts` - UI state management
- `src/renderer/stores/settings-store.ts` - Settings management
- `src/renderer/stores/types.ts` - Store type definitions
- `src/renderer/stores/index.ts` - Store exports

### Feature 6: Development Environment
**Description**: Configure development tools, scripts, and quality assurance.

**Tasks**:
1. Set up ESLint and Prettier with project-specific rules
2. Configure Jest for testing with React Testing Library
3. Add development scripts for running, building, and testing
4. Set up VS Code configuration with recommended extensions
5. Create basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

**Deliverables**:
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
- `prettier.config.js` - Prettier configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Jest testing configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Basic CI workflow

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "electron": "^27.0.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "zustand": "^4.4.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^5.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.0",
    "jest": "^29.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Security Configuration
- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled
- Sandbox mode enabled
- Web security enabled
- Proper CSP headers

### File Structure Validation
- All files follow naming conventions from project-rules.md
- Maximum 500 lines per file
- Proper JSDoc documentation
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- UI component rendering tests
- Store state management tests
- Utility function tests
- IPC communication tests

### Integration Tests
- Electron main/renderer communication
- Window management functionality
- Basic navigation flow
- Error boundary behavior

### Manual Testing
- Application launches successfully
- Basic UI interactions work
- Window controls function properly
- Development hot reload works

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Electron Security**: Mitigated by following strict security configuration
- **TypeScript Complexity**: Mitigated by incremental adoption and proper tooling
- **Build Pipeline**: Mitigated by using established tools (Vite, Electron Builder)

### Development Risks
- **File Organization**: Mitigated by following project-rules.md structure
- **Code Quality**: Mitigated by automated linting and testing
- **Documentation**: Mitigated by mandatory JSDoc comments

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Application starts in under 5 seconds
- All TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- Basic UI components render correctly
- Window management works across different screen sizes

### Quality Metrics
- 100% TypeScript coverage (no `any` types)
- ESLint passes with zero warnings
- All tests pass
- File structure follows project-rules.md

### Development Metrics
- Hot reload works in under 2 seconds
- Build process completes in under 30 seconds
- Development environment setup takes under 10 minutes

## Next Phase Preparation

This phase prepares for Phase 1 (MVP) by establishing:
- Solid foundation for Firebase integration
- Component structure ready for complex UI features
- State management ready for document workflows
- Security foundation for API integrations
- Development environment ready for rapid iteration

The application at the end of this phase will be a basic desktop application that opens and displays a simple interface, but does not yet implement BrainLift document creation or research functionality.
