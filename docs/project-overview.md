# BrainLift Generator - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

The BrainLift Generator is a Windows desktop application designed to automate the creation of BrainLift documents - structured prompts that guide Large Language Models beyond consensus thinking to identify potential SpikyPOVs (contrarian viewpoints with evidence). 

**Problem Statement:** Currently, creating a BrainLift document is time-intensive, particularly the research phases for Experts, SpikyPOVs, and Knowledge Tree sections. This manual process creates a bottleneck in the AI-first development workflow.

**Solution:** An Electron-based desktop application that combines interactive Purpose refinement with automated background research workflows, leveraging LangGraph for intelligent orchestration and real-time web search capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Reduce BrainLift document creation time from hours to minutes by automating research-intensive sections
2. **User Experience Goal:** Maintain the enjoyable interactive Purpose refinement while eliminating tedious research tasks
3. **Quality Goal:** Generate comprehensive, multi-perspective research with 3-5 high-quality sources per section
4. **Integration Goal:** Seamlessly integrate with existing project workflow by saving documents to project-specific directories
5. **Transparency Goal:** Provide full visibility into research sources and methodology for user trust and verification

## User Stories

**As a developer in an AI-first coding program, I want to:**
- Quickly initiate BrainLift creation through an interactive chat interface so I can efficiently define my project's purpose
- Have the application automatically research Experts, SpikyPOVs, and Knowledge Tree sections in the background so I can focus on other project setup tasks
- Receive notifications when research is complete so I know when to review the generated content
- Review and edit the AI-generated research before finalizing so I maintain control over the final document quality
- Save completed BrainLift documents to my specific project directories so they integrate seamlessly with my existing workflow
- Access a history of my previous BrainLift documents so I can reference and learn from past projects
- See the sources used in research so I can verify credibility and explore topics further if needed

8.4. The system must allow users to verify and explore sources independently

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-platform Support:** Initial version will be Windows-only (no macOS or Linux support)
2. **Real-time Collaboration:** Single-user application without sharing or collaboration features
3. **Template Customization:** Fixed BrainLift structure without user-customizable templates
