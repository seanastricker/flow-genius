Thought Process on choosing my problem:
- The first two problems that immediately came to mind were an improved Excel spreadsheet app or a BrainLift generator.
- I decided to go with the BrainLift Generator over the improved Excel spreadsheet for a few reasons:
    - I wanted to better understand BrainLifts, which I would learn by implementing this project
    - I wanted a "research-assistant" to speed up my research process, but also to provide me information I may have overlooked.
    - I wanted a way to quickly format a BrainLift because I had never had a formal BrainLift document on my past projects.  They have always been scattered notes.
    - I also thought that other members in the Cohort could benefit from this, not just me.
 
Was there a solution already?
- I did a quick search on whether there was an existing solution, but I didn't find a solution specific to BrainLift research/documentation, at least not presented in the way that was instructed to us.
- I wanted my specific solution to allow me to chat back and forth with an AI bot before it started generating research information, that way I could guarantee we were both on the same page.  I also wanted to guarantee that I was able to export a consolidated file, so that my BrainLifts going forward were well structured.
