Thought Process on choosing my problem:
- The first two problems that immediately came to mind were an improved Excel spreadsheet app or a BrainLift generator.
- I decided to go with the BrainLift Generator over the improved Excel spreadsheet for a few reasons:
    - I wanted to better understand BrainLifts, which I would learn by implementing this project
    - I wanted a "research-assitant" to speed up my research process, but also to provide me information I may have overlooked.
    - I wanted a way to quickly format a BrainLift because I had never had a formal BrainLift document on my past projects.  They have always been scattered notes.
    - I also thought that other members in the Cohort could benefit from this, not just me.
 - I did a quick search on whether there was an existing solution, but I didn't find a solution specific to BrainLift research/documentation, at least not presented in the way that was instructed to us.
